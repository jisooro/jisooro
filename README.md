Hello, I’m @jisooro. Nice to meet you!

I’m a Software Engineer / React Native Developer. Welcome to my Github repository!!
I’ve been working as a Freelancer since 2019 and when I started to learn to program mobile apps in React Native, I decided that was the path I wanted to take in my career. Feel free to check my portfolio, there are several projects that I've participated for different clients and also some of my personal projects.

You can reach me here:
